\begin{abstract}
The \sysname tool enables lateral decomposition of a multi-dimensional
flux compensator along the timing and space axes.

The abstract serves as an executive summary of your project.
Your abstract should cover at least the following topics, 1-2 sentences for
each: what area you are in, the problem you focus on, why existing work is
insufficient, what the high-level intuition of your work is, maybe a neat
design or implementation decision, and key results of your evaluation.
\end{abstract}

%\begin{frenchabstract}
%For a doctoral thesis, you have to provide a French translation of the
%English abstract. For other projects this is optional.
