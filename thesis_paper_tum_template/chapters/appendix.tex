\section{Results}
\label{an:results}

The runtimes for the benchmarks for these graphs can be found at the following link. The files follow the following naming scheme: "n-m\_type", where n is the lower bound of nodes in the benchmark, m is the upper bound of nodes, type is the type code of graph this benchmark was run on. Each subsection of this annex will detail what type code is used for graphs in this section. For example, dense graphs have type code \texttt{dense}, so the runtimes for such a dense graph on graphs containing between zero and 2000 nodes will be: \texttt{0-2000\_dense}
