def prepare_graph(vertices, edges, sink_frac=0.2, seed=None):
    """
    Transforms a graph into a valid Liquid Democracy Delegation Graph by performing the following operations:
    
    - Merges multiple (parallel) edges between the same nodes into a single edge, eliminating duplicates.
        Of the duplicate edges only one, random edge is kept.
    - Ensures that at least sinks % (default 20%) of nodes are sinks (outdegree 0)
        Edges are removed randomely until this condition is met
    - Normalizes the edge weights for each node such that the sum of outgoing edge weights equals 1.
    - Removes delegation cycles (terminal strongly connected components (SCCs))
        A terminal SCC is a strongly connected component that has outgoing edges, but none of them to nodes outside of
        the SCC (so sinks are not terminal SCCS). If all such terminal SCCs are collapsed into a single 
        node called "lost". This process is repeated until no terminal SCCs remain.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    vertices : iterable
        A list of the graph's vertices (nodes).
    edges : list of tuples
        A list of edges where each edge is a tuple:
        - (u, v, weight) 
        - (u, v) 
    sink_frac: float
        The percentage of nodes that should be sinks (outdegree 0). Default is 0.2 (20%).
